# IoT Assignment 2 - Desktop App

This app will read from the arduino serial line and save the comms in a simple text file.
The data will be used to create graphs and logs on a web page.

Comms between arduino and this script will use the following json format:
```
{
    "log_level": 1,
    "component": 2,
    "data": "32.10",
    "comment": "Water level read."
}
```
